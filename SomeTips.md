# Here some useful tips that help me hackintoshing :

i usually recommend using this with Niresh Catalina distro (worked for me) Here the link :

After booting the installer you will need to press continue, but if your mouse does not work you can try forcefully and repeatedly pressing Enter, Alt(Option) and Space key and enable VoiceOver

after that you need to partition your drive, select the disk utility in utility menu at the top bar

i highly recommend you to partition your drive as apfs

after that you need to open terminal, select the terminal in utility menu at the top bar

and type "date 0502200022" 

and press windows key + Q 

after that you need to press custumize, at this point i usually unchecked every option exept the hackintosh links because disabling it can cause problems

and install, simple right?
